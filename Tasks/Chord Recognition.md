Infer #chords (mostly according to wester #music-theory). As a powerful framework to look at the structure of a composition. 

- The [[Chroma Vector]] is a simple baseline representation which can be associated with chords. It is used in [[Compound Word Transformer]] to compare #harmony informtion for evaluation purposes.
- A very impactful baseline for neural chord recognition is the [[Harmony Transformer]] [^@chenHarmonyTransformerIncorporating2019]
- The impactful [[Pop Music Transformer]] uses a modified "[[Viterbi Algorithm]]" to infer chords. [^@huangPopMusicTransformer2020]
