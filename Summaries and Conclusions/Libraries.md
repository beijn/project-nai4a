 
Besides the libraries that come with most of the presented papers, there are highly usefull more general frameworks, that have not yet merrited an own entry. 
- [[Musicaiz]] [^@hernandez-olivanMusicaizPythonLibrary2022] is a recent attempt to provide a unified framework for *Symbolic Music Generation, Analysis and Visualization* by providing submodules for different common aspects and steps they identify when dealing with the topic of this work.  [source](https://github.com/carlosholivan/musicaiz) [docs](https://carlosholivan.github.io/musicaiz/index.html)
- [[MidiTok]] [^@fradetMidiTokPythonPackage2021] implements a comprehensive and recent overview of tokenization strategies [overview and source](https://github.com/Natooz/MidiTok).  A Python library summarizing multiple methods to tokenize MIDI files for usage with sequential Deep Learning models like Transformers or Recurrent Neural Networks. Enables easy swapping between and fair comparison of tokenization methods.
- [librosa](https://librosa.org/)[^librosa] implements many useful parts for MIR research, including algorithms to extract all kinds of information which can be used in training, data preparation and evaluation.
