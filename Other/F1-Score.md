The F1-Score can be used as a measure for reconstruction quality with #autoregressive models.  
It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. 

- The harmonic mean balances different ratios. If multiple ratios have different scales, the geometric mean will be highly disturbed by the ratio with the biggest values.
- Prediction precision is (true positive) / (true positive + false positive)
- Prediction recall is (true positive) / (true positive + false negative)

For an application that gives context and contast, see [[MuTE#On BLEU]].
